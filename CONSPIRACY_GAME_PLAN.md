### **MISSION: "THE VENEZUELA REGIME CHANGE SAGA"**
```
YEAR: 2002-2024
YOUR ROLE: CIA operative / US State Department official

SITUATION:
Venezuela has the world's largest oil reserves.
Chavez (1999-2013) and Maduro (2013-present) nationalized oil,
used wealth for poor, refused US control.

=== PART 1: THE 2002 COUP ===
Chavez is kidnapped by business-military alliance.
Bush administration immediately recognizes the coup government.

CHOICES:
1. Support the coup (bribe generals, fund opposition media)
   → Outcome: Coup fails after 48 hours; Chavez purges military, becomes more authoritarian
2. Warn Chavez about the coup
   → Outcome: You're fired, labeled "pro-dictator," career destroyed
3. Play both sides
   → Outcome: CIA doesn't trust you, Chavez doesn't either

REAL HISTORY:
- Chavez election: Certified by Jimmy Carter as fair (1998)
- 2002 coup: Pedro Carmona (businessman) dissolved constitution
- CIA documents: Later acknowledged "providing assistance" to opposition
- Oil nationalization: Before Chavez, 80% of oil profits went to US companies
- NED (National Endowment for Democracy): Funded opposition groups

=== PART 2: THE ECONOMIC WARFARE (2010s) ===
Oil prices crash, US imposes sanctions, opposition protests.

CHOICES:
1. Impose crippling sanctions
   → Outcome: Economy collapses, 7 million flee, but Maduro stays in power
2. Fund opposition protests (Guaidó declared "interim president")
   → Outcome: 50+ countries recognize Guaidó, but he never controls territory
3. Negotiate behind the scenes
   → Outcome: Sanctions relief in exchange for elections (2024 talks)

REAL HISTORY:
- Oil price: From $100/barrel (2013) to $30/barrel (2016)
- Hyperinflation: Reached 1,000,000% in 2018
- Sanctions: US seized Citgo, blocked oil exports, froze assets
- Humanitarian crisis: 90% in poverty, medicine shortages
- Guaidó (2019): Recognized by US, EU, but couldn't take power

=== PART 3: THE MADURO ABDUCTION ATTEMPT (2024) ===
OPERATION: "THE EXTRACTION"

SITUATION:
July 2024: Maduro's plane disappears mid-flight.
Alternative theory: US special forces abduct him from Miraflores Palace.
Leaked audio: Secret meeting discussing "removal operation."
Russia and China issue ultimatum: "Return him or face consequences."

CHOICES:
1. Execute the abduction (Black-site interrogation in Guantánamo)
   → Outcome: Venezuela falls into chaos, US-installed puppet takes over
              Russia sends Wagner mercenaries, China sends "advisors"
              Caracas becomes Baghdad 2003: insurgency, bombings, civil war
   → REVELATION: This was planned since 2019 (Trump considered it)

2. Leak the operation to prevent it
   → Outcome: Maduro launches purges, executes plotters, becomes full dictator
              You're hunted by CIA, branded traitor
   → REVELATION: This is why Trump said "all options are on the table"

3. Create a false narrative (Maduro "defected" willingly)
   → Outcome: Propaganda campaign, but nobody believes it
              Russia releases proof he was abducted
   → REVELATION: US lies about regime change operations (like Iran 1953)

4. Blackmail Maduro instead (use corruption evidence)
   → Outcome: He opens oil to US companies, keeps power
              You get rich, but betray Venezuelan people

REAL HISTORY (What we know):
- Trump 2020: "I was presented with a plan to invade Venezuela... Marines to get Maduro"
- Maduro's accusations: "The CIA is planning to assassinate or abduct me"
- US indicted Maduro: Drug trafficking charges (bounty on his head)
- Russia: Sent troops to protect Maduro (2020)
- China: Venezuela debt owed: $20 billion (oil-for-loans)

THE ALTERNATIVE THEORY (Game's fictional scenario):
July 28, 2024: Maduro wins disputed election.
Opposition leader González claims fraud.
US State Department: "Maduro must go."
August 2024: Secret authorization for "decapitation operation."
WHAT HAPPENED: Two competing theories:
1. Official: Maduro won (but was it rigged?)
2. Game version: He was abducted, then "returned" after secret deal

=== PART 4: THE AFTERMATH ===

IF ABDUCTION SUCCEEDS:
- Venezuela becomes US client state (like post-2003 Iraq)
- Russian bases in Caribbean (Cuba, Nicaragua expand)
- China loses $20 billion, sends warships to protect investment
- 10 million Venezuelans displaced
- US oil companies take over PDVSA (Citgo already seized in 2019)
- Insurgency begins: "Maduristas" fight US occupation

IF ABDUCTION FAILS:
- Maduro executes opposition leaders
- Full dictatorship established (Cuban model)
- US invades (like Panama 1989)
- Urban warfare in Caracas
- Body bags come home (like Somalia 1993)
- Russia and China supply Maduro with weapons
- Vietnam 2.0 in South America

REVELATION: The game shows that regime change ALWAYS creates chaos,
            but the Military-Industrial Complex profits either way

=== HISTORICAL PARALLELS ===
- Iran 1953: CIA overthrew Mossadegh for oil (worked temporarily)
- Guatemala 1954: CIA overthrew Arbenz for United Fruit (worked, led to civil war)
- Chile 1973: CIA overthrew Allende, installed Pinochet (worked, 17 years dictatorship)
- Iraq 2003: US overthrew Saddam (disaster: 500,000 dead, ISIS created)
- Libya 2011: NATO overthrew Gaddafi (disaster: Slave markets, civil war continues)
- Venezuela 2024: Will it be another Chile or another Iraq?

THE ULTIMATE CONSPIRACY:
Every regime change follows the same playbook:
1. Economic warfare (sanctions, IMF, currency manipulation)
2. Propaganda (dictator = Hitler, must be removed)
3. Fund opposition (NED, USAID, CIA front companies)
4. Protests/riots (peaceful demonstrators armed)
5. Coup/abduction/invasion (when above fails)
6. Install puppet (ex: Guaidó was going to privatize everything)
7. Extract resources (oil, minerals, cheap labor)

The game lets you PLAY as the orchestrator or the resister.
```

### **🎯 SPECIAL FEATURE: THE REGIME CHANGE PLAYBOOK**
```
Throughout the game, players discover "THE PLAYBOOK" - a step-by-step guide
used by the CIA/State Department to overthrow governments since 1947.

THE 7-STEP PLAYBOOK (Game mechanics):

=== STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE TARGET ===
- Leader who nationalizes resources (oil, minerals, copper)
- Leader who refuses US/IMF loans
- Leader who allies with US enemies (Russia, China, Iran)
- Leader who implements policies that hurt US corporations

GAME EXAMPLES:
- Iran 1951: Mossadegh nationalized Anglo-Iranian Oil
- Guatemala 1951: Arbenz nationalized United Fruit land
- Chile 1970: Allende nationalized copper mines
- Venezuela 1999: Chavez rewrote oil law, took 80% of profits
- Libya 2009: Gaddafi planned gold-backed currency

=== STEP 2: DEMONIZATION ===
- Media campaign: Leader = "dictator," "tyrant," "new Hitler"
- Human rights abuses highlighted (ignored when ally)
- Economic problems blamed on leader (not sanctions)
- False flag operations staged

GAME MECHANIC:
You control media narratives. Choose which stories to amplify.
- Expose corruption: Real or fabricated?
- Highlight protests: Peaceful or violent?
- Military abuses: True or exaggerated?

=== STEP 3: ECONOMIC WARFARE ===
- IMF loans: Conditional on austerity
- Currency manipulation: Speculative attacks
- Sanctions: Block trade, freeze assets
- Capital flight: Corporations leave

GAME EXAMPLES:
- Chile 1970-73: CIA cut off credit, funded truckers' strike
- Venezuela 2013+: Oil price crash + sanctions = collapse
- Nicaragua 1980s: CIA mined harbors, cut off trade
- Iran 2012+: Oil sanctions crippled economy

=== STEP 4: FUND OPPOSITION ===
- NED (National Endowment for Democracy): CIA cutout
- USAID: "Democracy promotion"
- NGO network: Student groups, labor unions, media
- Weapons: "Non-lethal" aid to "peaceful protesters"

GAME MECHANIC:
You have $X million to spend. Where does it go?
- Fund student protests → Regime falls, but creates radicals
- Arm opposition → Civil war (Syria 2011)
- Bribe military → Coup (Egypt 2013, Mali 2012)
- Create parallel institutions → Guaidó 2019

=== STEP 5: PROVOCATION ===
- Snipers fire on protesters (both sides)
- False flag: Blame regime for violence
- Border incident: Create crisis
- "Terrorist" attack: Justify intervention

GAME EXAMPLES:
- Venezuela 2002: Snipers fired on Chavistas and opposition
- Syria 2012: "chemical weapons" - later questioned
- Gulf of Tonkin 1964: Never happened ( McNamara admitted it later)
- Iraq 2003: WMDs - fabricated evidence

=== STEP 6: THE COUP/INVASION/ABDUCTION ===
When all else fails:
1. MILITARY COUP (Chile 1973, Argentina 1976, Egypt 2013)
2. ARMED INSURGENCY (Nicaragua 1980s, Afghanistan 1980s, Syria 2011)
3. INVASION (Panama 1989, Iraq 2003, Grenada 1983)
4. ABDUCTION/ASSASSINATION (new in game: Venezuela 2024)

GAME MECHANIC:
You choose the method based on:
- Target country's military strength
- International support/opposition
- Russia/China response (will they intervene?)
- Public opinion at home

=== STEP 7: THE AFTERMATH ===
- Install puppet (ex: Pinochet, Guaidó, Karzai)
- Privatize state assets (sell to US corporations)
- Open to foreign investment (extract resources)
- Build military bases (projection of power)
- Suppress resistance (death squads, disappearances)

GAME OUTCOMES:
SUCCESS: Chile 1973-1990 (17 years dictatorship, then "democracy")
MIXED: Afghanistan 2001-2021 (20 years, Taliban won)
FAILURE: Cuba 1961-present (60+ years, still communist)
DISASTER: Iraq 2003-present (500,000 dead, ISIS created)
ONGOING: Venezuela 2002-present (Sanctions, Guaidó failed, now... abduction?)

=== PLAYER CHOICE ===
As you progress through the game, you can:
1. EXECUTE THE PLAYBOOK: Become the imperialist
2. RESIST THE PLAYBOOK: Try to stop regime change
3. EXPOSE THE PLAYBOOK: Risk assassination
4. REFORM THE PLAYBOOK: Can it be done ethically?

Each choice reveals different historical documents and truths.
The ultimate question: Is regime change ever justified?

### **MISSION: "THE AFGHAN OPIUM TRADE"**
```
YEAR: 2001-2021
YOUR ROLE: Special Forces commander

SITUATION:
Taliban banned opium in 2000 (crashed global heroin supply).
After 2001 invasion, Afghanistan becomes #1 opium producer.

CHOICES:
1. Protect opium trade (CIA needs black budget money)
   → Outcome: Afghan heroin epidemic worldwide, secret operations funded
2. Eradicate opium (lose local warlords' support)
   → Outcome: Taliban resurgent because farmers have no other income
3. Tax the trade (become warlord yourself)
   → Outcome: You're rich, but contribute to global addiction crisis

REAL HISTORY:
- Taliban 2000-2001: Reduced opium production by 99%
- Post-2001: Opium production increased 40x
- US marines guarded opium fields (documented by embedded journalists)
- Global heroin supply: 90% from US-occupied Afghanistan

REVELATION: War on drugs is a lie; drugs fund black operations
```

### **MISSION: "THE PANDEMIC ORIGINS"**
```
YEAR: 2019-2020
YOUR ROLE: NIH / EcoHealth Alliance scientist

SITUATION:
Gain-of-function research on coronaviruses at Wuhan lab.
Fauci's agency funded it through EcoHealth.

CHOICES:
1. Suppress the lab leak theory (call it "conspiracy theory")
   → Outcome: Protect scientific establishment, but truth buried
2. Whistleblow on the research
   → Outcome: You're destroyed (like Dr. Li Wenliang who died mysteriously)
3. Use the pandemic to implement your agenda
   → Outcome: Power, but at the cost of millions of lives

REAL HISTORY:
- Fauci emails: Show concern about lab leak early in pandemic
- Wuhan Institute of Virology: Studied bat coronaviruses
- Gain-of-function: Making viruses more contagious to study vaccines
- Peter Daszak (EcoHealth): Organized scientists to call lab leak "conspiracy"

REVELATION: Pandemic may have been caused by US-funded research
```
