# 🇻🇪 VENEZUELA MISSION - QUICK REFERENCE

## 🎮 "THE VENEZUELA REGIME CHANGE SAGA" (2002-2024)

### **What's New in the Game:**

---

## 📋 MISSION OVERVIEW

### **4-Part Epic Mission:**

1. **PART 1: The 2002 Coup** (Failed regime change)
2. **PART 2: Economic Warfare** (2010s sanctions)
3. **PART 3: The Maduro Abduction Attempt** (2024 fictional scenario)
4. **PART 4: The Aftermath** (Multiple endings)

---

## 🎯 KEY CONSPIRACY ELEMENTS

### **Real Historical Facts:**
- ✅ Chavez elected in 1998 (certified free by Jimmy Carter)
- ✅ 2002 coup lasted 48 hours (Pedro Carmona dissolved constitution)
- ✅ CIA admitted "providing assistance" to opposition (declassified 2017+)
- ✅ US recognized the coup government immediately
- ✅ Oil was nationalized (80% of profits went to poor, not US companies)

### **Controversial Claims (Game presents as theories):**
- ⚠️ NED/USAID funded opposition groups (documented)
- ⚠️ Sanctions intentionally caused humanitarian crisis (debatable)
- ⚠️ Guaidó was US puppet (50+ countries recognized him)
- ⚠️ 2024 abduction attempt (pure fiction/game scenario)

---

## 🎮 PLAYER CHOICES

### **In Part 1 (2002 Coup):**
```
1. Support the coup → Chavez becomes authoritarian
2. Warn Chavez → You're fired, career destroyed
3. Play both sides → Neither side trusts you
```

### **In Part 2 (Economic Warfare):**
```
1. Impose sanctions → 7 million flee, Maduro stays
2. Fund Guaidó → He never controls territory
3. Negotiate → Sanctions relief (2024 talks)
```

### **In Part 3 (Abduction Attempt - FICTIONAL):**
```
1. Execute abduction → Venezuela becomes Iraq 2.0
2. Leak the operation → Maduro becomes full dictator
3. False narrative → Nobody believes it
4. Blackmail Maduro → He opens oil to US
```

## 📚 HISTORICAL PARALLELS IN GAME

The mission teaches the **Regime Change Playbook**:

| Country | Year | Method | Outcome |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| **Iran** | 1953 | Coup | Success (temporarily) |

## 🔥 THE ABDUCTION SCENARIO (2024)

### **Setup:**
- July 2024: Maduro wins disputed election
- Opposition claims fraud
- US says "Maduro must go"
- **FICTIONAL:** Secret authorization for "decapitation operation"

### **Two Competing Theories in Game:**
1. **Official:** Maduro won (maybe rigged?)
2. **Conspiracy:** He was abducted, then "returned"

### **Outcomes Based on Player Choice:**

#### **If Abduction Succeeds:**
```
🇻🇪 Venezuela → US client state
🇷🇺 Russia → Bases in Caribbean
🇨🇳 China → Warships to protect $20B investment
👥 10M refugees
💰 US oil companies take over PDVSA
💥 Insurgency begins (Maduristas)
```

#### **If Abduction Fails:**
```
🔫 Maduro executes opposition
🎭 Full dictatorship (Cuban model)
🪖 US invasion (like Panama 1989)
🏙️ Urban warfare in Caracas
⚰️ Body bags come home
🎯 Vietnam 2.0 in South America
```

## 💡 GAMEPLAY MECHANICS

### **The "Playbook" System:**
Players discover the **7-step regime change playbook**:

1. **Identify Target** (leader who nationalizes resources)
2. **Demonization** (media campaign: "dictator," "tyrant")
3. **Economic Warfare** (sanctions, IMF, currency manipulation)
4. **Fund Opposition** (NED, USAID, NGOs, weapons)
5. **Provocation** (false flags, snipers, border incidents)
6. **Coup/Invasion/Abduction** (when all else fails)
7. **Aftermath** (puppet government, privatization, bases)

### **Player Can:**
- ✅ Execute the playbook (become the imperialist)
- ✅ Resist the playbook (try to stop regime change)
- ✅ Expose the playbook (risk assassination)
- ✅ Reform the playbook (can it be ethical?)

---

## 🎯 LEARNING OUTCOMES

### **What Players Learn:**

1. **Regime change has a playbook** - Not spontaneous
2. **Same patterns repeat** - Iran (1953) → Venezuela (2002)
3. **Resources are the motive** - Oil, copper, bananas
4. **Humanitarian disasters** - Sanctions hurt ordinary people
5. **Blowback is real** - Iraq created ISIS, Cuba 60+ years of resistance
6. **No good options** - Every choice has terrible consequences

---

## 🚨 CONTROVERSIAL ELEMENTS

### **Why This Mission is Controversial:**

- 🇺🇸 **US actions**: CIA involvement, sanctions, recognition of coup
- 🇻🇪 **Maduro regime**: Dictatorship or democratic? (debatable)
- 🇷🇺 **Russia/China**: Protecting sovereignty or protecting investment?
- 📰 **Media bias**: Both sides claim "fake news"
- 💀 **Humanitarian crisis**: Sanctions vs. mismanagement?

### **Game's Stance:**
> "This game explores conspiracy theories as narratives. Players are encouraged to research these events independently and draw their own conclusions."

## 🔚 CONCLUSION

This mission asks the **ultimate question**:

> **"Is regime change ever justified, or does it always create chaos?"**

Players must decide:

**The game doesn't give easy answers.**
